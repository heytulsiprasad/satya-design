export const about = [
  "I began my career as a web developer, learning a variety of skills such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript, and thoroughly enjoying developing the front end. However, once I started learning backend, I realized it wasn't my ideal, so I moved on to design. I was enthralled by the impact that design has on people's lives. It became clear to me that design can be found in any area. This is how I became interested in design and began working as a designer.",
  'I worked for a range of organizations, some of which were just starting and others that were well-established. They allowed me to work on some incredible products with incredible people while also teaching me a lot about product design and users. During this journey, I learned how to plan a product development roadmap, which is necessary for a smooth workflow. After understanding the business and user needs through user research and empathizing with them, I map the product and build a better architecture for it. The wireframing and final designs are then completed. To ensure that a high-quality product is delivered on time, I work closely with the design and development teams.',
